## Use of application examples
Application examples illustrate the solution of automation tasks through an interaction of several components in the form of text, graphics and/or software modules. The application examples are a free service by Siemens AG and/or a subsidiary of Siemens AG (“Siemens”). They are nonbinding and make no claim to completeness or functionality regarding configuration and equipment. The application examples merely offer help with typical tasks; they do not constitute customer-specific solutions. You yourself are responsible for the proper and safe operation of the products in accordance with applicable regulations and must also check the function of the respective application example and customize it for your system.

Siemens grants you the non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable right to have the application examples used by technically trained personnel. Any change to the application examples is your responsibility. Sharing the application examples with third parties or copying the application examples or excerpts thereof is permitted only in combination with your own products. The application examples are not required to undergo the customary tests and quality inspections of a chargeable product; they may have functional and performance defects as well as errors. It is your responsibility to use them in such a manner that any malfunctions that may occur do not
result in property damage or injury to persons.

## Disclaimer of liability

Siemens shall not assume any liability, for any legal reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, liability for the usability, availability, completeness and freedom from defects of the application examples as well as for related information, configuration and performance data and any damage caused thereby. This shall not apply in cases of mandatory liability, for example under the German Product Liability Act, or in cases of intent, gross negligence, or culpable loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health, non-compliance with a guarantee, fraudulent non-disclosure of a defect, or culpable breach of material contractual obligations. Claims for damages arising from a breach of material contractual obligations shall however be limited to the foreseeable damage typical of the type of agreement, unless liability arises from intent or gross negligence or is based on loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health. The foregoing provisions
do not imply any change in the burden of proof to your detriment. You shall indemnify Siemens against existing or future claims of third parties in this connection except where Siemens is mandatorily liable. 

By using the application examples you acknowledge that Siemens cannot be held liable for any damage beyond the liability provisions described.

## Other information

Siemens reserves the right to make changes to the application examples at any time without notice. In case of discrepancies between the suggestions in the application examples and other Siemens publications such as catalogs, the content of the other documentation shall have
precedence. The Siemens terms of use (https://support.industry.siemens.com) shall also apply.
## Security information

Siemens provides products and solutions with industrial security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks against cyber threats, it is necessary to implement – and continuously maintain – a holistic, state-of-the-art industrial security concept. Siemens’ products and solutions constitute one element of such a concept.
Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Such systems, machines and components should only be connected to an enterprise network or the Internet if and to the extent such a connection is necessary and only
when appropriate security measures (e.g. firewalls and/or network segmentation) are in place. For additional information on industrial security measures that may be implemented, please visit https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity.

Siemens’ products and solutions undergo continuous development to make them more secure. Siemens strongly recommends that product updates are applied as soon as they are available and that the latest product versions are used. Use of product versions that are no longer
supported, and failure to apply the latest updates may increase customer’s exposure to cyber threats.
